## Introduction

The deconstruction expression is like an archaeologist carefully extracting artifacts from a dig site. Just as an archaeologist separates and categorizes different items found in a single location, the deconstruction expression takes a single object and extracts its individual components into separate variables. This allows you to work with each component independently, making your code more readable and focused.

In the world of programming, we often need to work with complex data structures that contain multiple related values. Before deconstruction, accessing these individual values required multiple lines of code or temporary variables. The deconstruction expression provides an elegant syntax for unpacking these values in a single step, reducing boilerplate code and making your intentions clearer.

## Basic deconstruction

A deconstruction expression extracts data fields from an instance of an object. Each discrete data element is written to a distinct variable, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
var tuple = (X: 1, Y: 2);
var (x, y) = tuple;

Console.WriteLine(x); // output: 1
Console.WriteLine(y); // output: 2
```

The code snippet creates a tuple that has two integer values, X and Y. The second statement deconstructs that tuple and stores the tuple elements in discrete variables x and y.

## Tuple deconstruction

All tuple types support deconstruction expressions. Tuple deconstruction extracts all the tuple's elements. If you only want some of the tuple elements, use a discard for the unused tuple members, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
var tuple2 = (X: 0, Y: 1, Label: "The origin");
var (x2, _, _) = tuple2;
```

In the preceding example, the Y and label members are discarded. You can specify multiple discards in the same deconstruction expression. You can use discards for all the members of the tuple. The following example is legal, although not useful:

```csharp
var (_, _, _) = tuple2;
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The discard pattern (`_`) is a placeholder for a variable you don't intend to use. It tells the compiler and other developers that this value is deliberately ignored.
{% endhint %}

## Record deconstruction

Record types that have a primary constructor support deconstruction for positional parameters. The compiler synthesizes a Deconstruct method that extracts the properties synthesized from positional parameters in the primary constructor. The compiler-synthesized Deconstruct method doesn't extract properties declared as properties in the record type.

The record shown in the following code declares two positional properties, SquareFeet and Address, along with another property, RealtorNotes:

```csharp
public record House(int SquareFeet, string Address)
{
    public required string RealtorNotes { get; set; }
}
```

When you deconstruct a House object, all positional properties, and only positional properties, are deconstructed, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
var house = new House(1000, "123 Coder St.")
{
    RealtorNotes = """
    This is a great starter home, with a separate room that's a great home office setup.
    """
};

var (squareFeet, address) = house;
Console.WriteLine(squareFeet); // output: 1000
Console.WriteLine(address); // output: 123 Coder St.
Console.WriteLine(house.RealtorNotes);
```

You can make use of this behavior to specify which properties of your record types are part of the compiler-synthesized Deconstruct method.

## Declare Deconstruct methods

You can add deconstruction support to any class, struct, or interface you declare. You declare one or more Deconstruct methods in your type, or as extension methods on that type. A deconstruction expression calls a method `void Deconstruct(out var p1, ..., out var pn)`. The Deconstruct method can be either an instance method or an extension method. The type of each parameter in the Deconstruct method must match the type of the corresponding argument in the deconstruction expression. The deconstruction expression assigns the value of each argument to the value of the corresponding out parameter in the Deconstruct method. If multiple Deconstruct methods match the deconstruction expression, the compiler reports an error for the ambiguity.

The following code declares a Point3D struct that has two Deconstruct methods:

```csharp
public struct Point3D
{
    public int X { get; set; }
    public int Y { get; set; }
    public int Z { get; set; }

    public void Deconstruct(out int x, out int y, out int z)
    {
        x = X;
        y = Y;
        z = Z;
    }

    public void Deconstruct(out int x, out int y)
    {
        x = X;
        y = Y;
    }
}
```

The first method supports deconstruction expressions that extract all three axis values: X, Y, and Z. The second method supports deconstructing only the planar values: X and Y. The first method has an arity of 3; the second has an arity of 2.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When implementing multiple Deconstruct methods, ensure they have different parameter counts (arities) to avoid ambiguity. If you need methods with the same arity but different parameter types, make sure the types are distinct enough that the compiler can resolve which method to call.
{% endhint %}

## Extension methods for deconstruction

You can add deconstruction support to types you don't own by creating extension methods:

```csharp
public static class DateTimeExtensions
{
    public static void Deconstruct(this DateTime date, out int year, out int month, out int day)
    {
        year = date.Year;
        month = date.Month;
        day = date.Day;
    }
}

// Usage
var date = new DateTime(2023, 12, 25);
var (year, month, day) = date;
Console.WriteLine($"{month}/{day}/{year}"); // output: 12/25/2023
```

This approach allows you to add deconstruction capabilities to existing types without modifying their source code.

## Deconstruction in foreach loops

Deconstruction expressions are particularly useful in foreach loops when working with collections of tuples or deconstructible types:

```csharp
var points = new List<(int X, int Y)>
{
    (0, 0),
    (1, 2),
    (3, 5)
};

foreach (var (x, y) in points)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Point: ({x}, {y})");
}
```

This makes iterating through collections of complex objects more concise and readable.

## Deconstruction with custom types

Let's look at a more complete example of using deconstruction with a custom type:

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; }
    public string LastName { get; }
    public DateOnly DateOfBirth { get; }

    public Person(string firstName, string lastName, DateOnly dateOfBirth)
    {
        FirstName = firstName;
        LastName = lastName;
        DateOfBirth = dateOfBirth;
    }

    public void Deconstruct(out string firstName, out string lastName)
    {
        firstName = FirstName;
        lastName = LastName;
    }

    public void Deconstruct(out string firstName, out string lastName, out DateOnly dateOfBirth)
    {
        firstName = FirstName;
        lastName = LastName;
        dateOfBirth = DateOfBirth;
    }

    public void Deconstruct(out string firstName, out string lastName, out int age)
    {
        firstName = FirstName;
        lastName = LastName;
        age = CalculateAge(DateOfBirth);
    }

    private static int CalculateAge(DateOnly birthDate)
    {
        var today = DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Today);
        int age = today.Year - birthDate.Year;
        if (birthDate > today.AddYears(-age)) age--;
        return age;
    }
}

// Usage
var person = new Person("John", "Doe", new DateOnly(1980, 1, 1));

// Basic deconstruction
var (firstName, lastName) = person;
Console.WriteLine($"{firstName} {lastName}");

// Deconstruction with date of birth
var (first, last, dob) = person;
Console.WriteLine($"{first} {last}, born on {dob}");

// Deconstruction with calculated age
var (f, l, age) = person;
Console.WriteLine($"{f} {l} is {age} years old");
```

This example shows how you can provide multiple Deconstruct methods with different semantics to give users flexibility in how they work with your types.

## Performance considerations

Deconstruction is generally efficient, as it's just a syntactic shorthand for calling a method and assigning values. However, there are a few things to keep in mind:

1. For tuples, the compiler generates optimized code that's as efficient as manual assignments
2. For record types, the compiler-generated Deconstruct method is a simple property extraction
3. For custom types, the performance depends on your implementation of the Deconstruct method

If your Deconstruct method performs complex calculations (like our age calculation example above), be aware that these calculations will happen every time the object is deconstructed.

## Key Points

- Deconstruction expressions extract multiple values from a single object into separate variables
- All tuple types support deconstruction out of the box
- Record types with positional parameters automatically support deconstruction
- You can add deconstruction support to any type by implementing one or more Deconstruct methods
- Deconstruct methods must return void and use out parameters for the extracted values
- You can provide multiple Deconstruct methods with different arities for flexibility
- Extension methods can add deconstruction support to types you don't own
- The discard pattern (`_`) can be used for values you don't need
- Deconstruction works well in foreach loops when working with collections of complex objects

## FAQs

**Q: Can I deconstruct into existing variables instead of declaring new ones?**  
A: Yes, you can deconstruct into existing variables using the following syntax: `(existingVar1, existingVar2) = tuple;`

**Q: What happens if I try to deconstruct an object that doesn't support deconstruction?**  
A: The compiler will generate an error indicating that there's no suitable Deconstruct method available for the type.

**Q: Can I use deconstruction with async methods?**  
A: Yes, but the Deconstruct method itself cannot be async. You can deconstruct the result of an awaited async method: `var (x, y) = await GetPointAsync();`

**Q: How does deconstruction differ from destructuring in JavaScript?**  
A: They're conceptually similar, but C# deconstruction requires explicit support through Deconstruct methods, while JavaScript destructuring works with any object's properties.

**Q: Can I use deconstruction with inheritance?**  
A: Yes, a derived class can inherit Deconstruct methods from its base class, override them, or add new ones with different arities.

**Q: Is there a performance penalty for using deconstruction?**  
A: For tuples and records, the performance is comparable to manual assignments. For custom types, it depends on your implementation of the Deconstruct method.

**Q: Can I use deconstruction with value tuples that have more than 7 elements?**  
A: Yes, but tuples with more than 7 elements use nested tuple types internally, which can make the deconstruction syntax a bit more complex.

**Q: How do I handle ambiguous Deconstruct methods?**  
A: If you have multiple Deconstruct methods with the same arity but different parameter types, make sure the types are distinct enough that the compiler can resolve which method to call. If ambiguity cannot be resolved, you'll need to use explicit casting or different method designs.
