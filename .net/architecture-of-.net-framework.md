# Architecture of .NET Framework

## Architecture of .NET Framework

The .NET Framework consists of two major components:

* **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**
* **.NET Framework Base Class Library (BCL)**

<table><thead><tr><th>Component</th><th width="447.9998779296875">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Common Language Runtime (CLR)</strong></td><td>Manages code execution, memory, thread management, type safety, and security.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Base Class Library (BCL)</strong></td><td>Provides fundamental types and APIs (strings, dates, numbers, collections, I/O).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Common Type System (CTS)</strong></td><td>Defines how types are declared, used, and managed consistently across all .NET languages.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Common Language Specification (CLS)</strong></td><td>Ensures interoperability among all .NET-supported programming languages.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### How .NET Applications Execute

Applications built on the .NET Framework typically use programming languages such as:

* **C#**
* **F#**
* **Visual Basic**

When compiled, source code is transformed into a language-neutral format called **Common Intermediate Language (CIL)**, which is packaged into files known as assemblies (`.dll` or `.exe`).

#### Runtime Execution Process:

1. **Assembly Loading**: When the application starts, CLR loads the compiled assemblies.
2. **Just-in-Time (JIT) Compilation**: CLR uses the JIT compiler to convert the CIL code into platform-specific machine code dynamically, optimizing execution for the current hardware.
3. **Execution**: The resulting machine code runs directly on the target computerâ€™s processor, delivering optimized and responsive application performance.
