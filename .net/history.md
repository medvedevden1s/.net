# History

### Origins of .NET

The idea behind .NET began in the **late 1990s**, as part of Microsoftâ€™s **Next Generation Windows Services (NGWS)** strategy. Microsoft envisioned a platform to simplify application development across multiple languages and systems.

In **2000**, Microsoft released the first beta of **.NET Framework**, which officially launched on **February 13, 2002**. It introduced key concepts still used today:

* **Common Language Runtime (CLR)** for managed code execution
* **Framework Class Library (FCL)** for consistent APIs
* Support for multiple languages via **Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)**

{% hint style="info" %}
.NET Framework was originally proprietary but quickly aligned with standards. CLI and C# were ratified by **ECMA** in 2001 and by **ISO** in 2003. The latest standard is [ECMA-334](https://ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-334_7th_edition_december_2023.pdf)\

### .NET Framework Era (2002â€“2022)

The original **.NET Framework** ran **exclusively on Windows** and powered Windows Forms, ASP.NET, WPF, and more.

### Shift to Cross-Platform: .NET Core (2016â€“2020)

By 2016, Microsoft recognized the need for a **modern, modular, open-source** version of .NET. Thus, **.NET Core** was born:

* Fully cross-platform: Windows, Linux, macOS
* Faster and more lightweight
* Command-line-first development model
* Emphasis on cloud-native and containerization

#### Key Releases

| Version  | Year | Notable Additions                    |
| -------- | ---- | ------------------------------------ |
| Core 1.0 | 2016 | First cross-platform release         |
| Core 2.0 | 2017 | Expanded APIs                        |
| Core 3.1 | 2019 | LTS, WPF/WinForms support on Windows |

### Unified Modern .NET: .NET 5 and Beyond

In **November 2020**, Microsoft introduced **.NET 5**, unifying the previously fragmented ecosystem:

* One SDK, one runtime
* Unified base class libraries
* Improved AOT, cloud, and performance tooling
* MAUI for cross-platform UI

### From Proprietary to Open Source

Initially met with scepticism by open-source communities due to licensing concerns and patent ambiguities, Microsoft gradually opened up the .NET ecosystem:

* In **2007**, .NET 3.5 libraries were published under a reference license.
* In **2014**, Microsoft extended its **patent promise** to cover more .NET technologies.
* In **2016**, after acquiring Xamarin, Microsoft **open-sourced Mono** under the **MIT License**.
* By **2018**, the source code for **WPF, WinForms, and WinUI** was released publicly.



{% hint style="info" %}
The entire modern .NET stack is now hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet), governed by the .NET Foundation, and built with community collaboration.\
