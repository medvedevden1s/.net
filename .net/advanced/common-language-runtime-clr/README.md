# Common Language Runtime (CLR)

The **Common Language Runtime (CLR)** is the heart of the .NET platform. It provides a managed execution environment where source code written in multiple languages is compiled into **Intermediate Language (IL)** and executed safely and efficiently.

CLR’s Execution Model



This chapter explains the CLR's core responsibilities and the step-by-step execution pipeline that begins with compiling source code and ends with running optimized native machine code.

***

### Compiling Source Code into Managed Modules

Before code can run on the CLR, it must first be compiled into a **managed module**. You can use various languages like C#, F#, or VB.NET—as long as they target the CLR.

Each language has its own compiler (e.g., `csc.exe` for C#), but regardless of the language, the result is the same: a managed module containing IL and metadata.

#### What Is a Managed Module?

A **managed module** is a standard `.exe` or `.dll` Portable Executable (PE32 or PE32+) file containing:

{% hint style="info" %}
All CLR-compliant compilers must emit both **IL** and **metadata**—together forming the managed module.\

{% endhint %}

### Combining Managed Modules into Assemblies

Although you compile source code into **modules**, the CLR itself works with **assemblies**—logical collections of modules and resources that act as the real building blocks in .NET.

#### What Is an Assembly?

An **assembly** is:

* A **logical unit** containing one or more managed modules and optional resource files.
* The **smallest unit of versioning, deployment, and security**.
* Self-describing through a **manifest**, which is a specialized metadata section.



#### The Manifest

The **manifest** describes:

* All files in the assembly
* Exported types and entry points
* Referenced assemblies and their versions
* Associated resources

\
A single-module `.dll` or `.exe` generated by `csc.exe` is already a valid assembly—it contains both code and a manifest.\


#### Single vs Multi-File Assemblies

* **Single-file assemblies** contain one module + manifest + resources.
* **Multi-file assemblies** (created with `AL.exe`) group multiple modules and resources, enabling flexible deployment scenarios.

For instance, less frequently used resources can be stored in separate files and loaded **on-demand** to save memory and disk space.

Assemblies are **self-contained**. No registry or external configuration is required. The CLR reads all dependency info directly from the manifest, making deployment and updates significantly simpler than traditional unmanaged components.
